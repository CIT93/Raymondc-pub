It really helped to explain how functions work. the first thing was to understand how functions are declred and how to call the function to run the code written in the function. nothing happens without calling the function.
also understaood how 
when we are sending something to the function, its call an arguement and when we receive it, it's called a parameter,
the parameter in the function is only available inside the function. the block scope can use variables in the global scope but the global scope cannot using variables from the function.
when you return a value, you need to capture the value by declaring a variable. 
you can use a default value if there is not assigned value you are passing into the function
